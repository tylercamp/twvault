Maintenance info for your server:

# Supporting Applications

The following applications were installed:
- dotnet-core runtime 3.1
- postgres 10
- nginx (acting as reverse-proxy)
- letsencrypt/certbot (automatically manages and renews HTTPS certs for your domain and registers them with NGINX)

Multiple vault services were installed (detailed below) and are accessible from the web. NGINX is being used as a reverse-proxy, so that HTTP requests to your server go to the right internal app. (Eg it's configured to forward requests to `/register` to the registration webapp, requests to `/api/forcerefresh` are forwarded to the map updating service, and other requests to `/api/` and `/scripts/` are forwarded to the main webapp.)

NGINX can also be configured to provide rate-limiting, whitelisting/blacklisting of IPs, and metrics via nginx-amplify. Up to you if you want to configure any of these.

# Vault

Vault stuff is installed to `/etc/twvault`. All services were installed running as root. There are the following apps:

- app: Main webapp that serves the script
- webmanage: Webapp providing `/register` page
- mapupdate: Webapp performing hourly auto-updates of all worlds registered in your DB
- dbinstall: Utility for initializing a newly-installed postgres database
- manage: Command-line utility for registering new worlds and deleting old ones. `manageconfig.sh` script was added to `/etc/twvault/` to make it easier to run. Use `cd /etc/twvault/manage && dotnet TW.ConfigurationFetcher.dll` to see its usage

The following apps are installed as services, which run on startup:
- `twvault-app`
- `twvault-manage`
- `twvault-map-fetcher`

Service definitions were installed to `/etc/systemd/system`. Services can be managed using `systemctl <start|stop|restart|status> service-name`.

Log files are found in `/etc/twvault/Logs`. Logs are available for all running vault services, named based on the service. The main webapp also includes IP logs.
